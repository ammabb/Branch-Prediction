Comparison of four branch predictor
1)In first testcase, I have taken q_sort traces as input file.
 a)Branch Prediction Algorithms:
   ALWAYS_TAKEN Branch Predictor
     Overall accuracy: 74.5224%
   ALWAYS_NOT_TAKEN Branch Predictor
     Overall accuracy: 25.4776%
   1-BIT BRANCH PREDICTOR (Taking first prediction as NOT TAKEN)
     Overall accuracy: 59.3535%
   2-BIT BRANCH PREDICTOR (Taking first prediction as WEAKLY TAKEN)
     Overall accuracy: 71.1032%
 b)Analysis:
   ALWAYS_TAKEN Branch Predictor:
     Achieves the highest overall accuracy of 74.5224%. This predictor assumes that all branches are taken, which is effective in scenarios where branches are predominantly taken.
   ALWAYS_NOT_TAKEN Branch Predictor:
     Demonstrates a significantly lower accuracy of 25.4776%. This predictor assumes that all branches are not taken, suitable for scenarios where branches are rarely taken.
   1-BIT BRANCH PREDICTOR (Taking first prediction as NOT TAKEN):
     Shows a moderate accuracy of 59.3535%. This predictor takes the first prediction as NOT TAKEN, which may lead to inaccuracies in cases where branches are frequently taken.
   2-BIT BRANCH PREDICTOR (Taking first prediction as WEAKLY TAKEN):
     Exhibits improved accuracy compared to the 1-bit predictor, with an accuracy of 71.1032%. By considering the first prediction as WEAKLY TAKEN, this predictor provides better adaptability to varying branch behaviors.
2)In second testcase, I have taken factorial traces as input file.
  a)Branch Prediction Algorithms:
    ALWAYS_TAKEN Branch Predictor
     Overall accuracy: 72.4467%
    ALWAYS_NOT_TAKEN Branch Predictor
     Overall accuracy: 27.5533%
    1-BIT BRANCH PREDICTOR (Taking first prediction as NOT TAKEN)
     Overall accuracy: 57.959%
    2-BIT BRANCH PREDICTOR (Taking first prediction as WEAKLY TAKEN)
     Overall accuracy: 67.7846%
  b)Analysis:
    ALWAYS_TAKEN Branch Predictor:
     Achieves an overall accuracy of 72.4467%. This predictor assumes that all branches are taken, making it suitable for scenarios where branches are predominantly taken.
    ALWAYS_NOT_TAKEN Branch Predictor:
     Demonstrates an overall accuracy of 27.5533%. This predictor assumes that all branches are not taken, making it suitable for scenarios where branches are rarely taken.
    1-BIT BRANCH PREDICTOR (Taking first prediction as NOT TAKEN):
     Shows a moderate overall accuracy of 57.959%. This predictor takes the first prediction as NOT TAKEN, which may lead to inaccuracies in cases where branches are frequently taken.
    2-BIT BRANCH PREDICTOR (Taking first prediction as WEAKLY TAKEN):
     Exhibits an overall accuracy of 67.7846%. By considering the first prediction as WEAKLY TAKEN, this predictor provides better adaptability to varying branch behaviors compared to the 1-bit predictor.
3)In third testcase, I have taken recursion traces as input file.
  a)Branch Prediction Algorithms:
    ALWAYS_TAKEN Branch Predictor
     Overall accuracy: 76.574%
    ALWAYS_NOT_TAKEN Branch Predictor
     Overall accuracy: 23.426%
    1-BIT BRANCH PREDICTOR (Taking first prediction as NOT TAKEN)
     Overall accuracy: 63.4523%
    2-BIT BRANCH PREDICTOR (Taking first prediction as WEAKLY TAKEN)
     Overall accuracy: 73.6092%
  b)Analysis:
    ALWAYS_TAKEN Branch Predictor:
     Achieves the highest overall accuracy of 76.574%. This predictor assumes that all branches are taken, which is effective in scenarios where branches are predominantly taken.
    ALWAYS_NOT_TAKEN Branch Predictor:
     Demonstrates a lower accuracy of 23.426%. This predictor assumes that all branches are not taken, suitable for scenarios where branches are rarely taken.
    1-BIT BRANCH PREDICTOR (Taking first prediction as NOT TAKEN):
     Shows a moderate accuracy of 63.4523%. This predictor takes the first prediction as NOT TAKEN, which may lead to inaccuracies in cases where branches are frequently taken.
    2-BIT BRANCH PREDICTOR (Taking first prediction as WEAKLY TAKEN):
     Exhibits a higher accuracy compared to the 1-bit predictor, with an accuracy of 73.6092%. By considering the first prediction as WEAKLY TAKEN, this predictor provides better adaptability to varying branch behaviors.

4)Conclusion:
The choice of branch prediction algorithm significantly impacts processor performance.
For scenarios where branches are predominantly taken, the ALWAYS_TAKEN predictor is recommended for optimal accuracy.
Conversely, in scenarios where branches are rarely taken, the ALWAYS_NOT_TAKEN predictor may be more suitable.
The 2-BIT BRANCH PREDICTOR with the strategy of considering the first prediction as WEAKLY TAKEN shows improved accuracy compared to the 1-bit predictor and could be a good compromise for general-purpose applications.
